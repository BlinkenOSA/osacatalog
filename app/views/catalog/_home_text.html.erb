            <p>The holdings are fully available through the integrated
            search. The Catalog is in English, with original titles in different
            languages included in the folder and item-level descriptions. Contextual

            (sub-fonds) and records groups (series) is provided as part of the
            archival hierarchy. The connections between digitized and born-digital
            holdings are established by cross-reference links which appear in the
            series level descriptions of archival records. For a detailed overview of
            the scope and diversity of our holdings, please consult the
